# Packaging

## Packaging {.smaller}

- Making people's life easier.
- Historically a mess in python.
  - The community has now standardised through PEP621 [@PEP621] on the pyproject.toml

setup.py
```python
#!usr/bin/env python

from setuptools import setup

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup()
```

__init__.py files for each module.

A minimal example:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools >= 61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "What my code does"
authors = [
  { name="M.E. Myself", email="m.myself@myemail.com" },
]
license = "LICENSE"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "numpy>=1.20.0",
    "scipy",
]
```

The Python Packaging Authority has a [guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) to writing the pyproject.toml file.
