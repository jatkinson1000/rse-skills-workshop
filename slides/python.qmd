- Be nice ([Python code of conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/))
- Ask questions whenever they arise.
  - Someone else is probably wondering the same thing.
- I will make mistakes.
  - Not all of them will be intentional.

## whoami {.smaller}

Research background in fluid mechanics and atmosphere:

- Numerics and fluid mechanics in Engineering,
- Cloud microphysics & volcanic plumes in Geography,
- Radiation belts and satellite data at BAS.

Now a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at the Institute of Computing for Climate
Science (ICCS) working with various 

This talk can be summarised as _"things I wish I'd known sooner."_

::: {.notes}
My background in this is domain science and numerical modelling on HPC.

## Other things {.smaller}

Beyond the scope of today are a few other honourable mentions:

- Functions and modules
- Packaging
  - Breaking projects into modules and `__init__.py`
  - Distributing projects with `pyproject.toml`
- Documentation
  - Auto-generation from docstrings with sphinx or mkdocs
- Type hinting
  - Adding type hinting to python code - how and why?
  - Type checking with mypy

These lessons will be added to the course content in future but are beyond the scope
of today.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

## Functions and modules


## Documentation

- Take the time now, it'll pay dividends later.
- The docstring payoff.


# Packaging

## Packaging {.smaller}

- Making people's life easier.
- Historically a mess in python.
  - The community has now standardised through PEP621 [@PEP621] on the pyproject.toml

setup.py
```python
#!usr/bin/env python

from setuptools import setup

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup()
```

__init__.py files for each module.

A minimal example:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools >= 61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "What my code does"
authors = [
  { name="M.E. Myself", email="m.myself@myemail.com" },
]
license = "LICENSE"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "numpy>=1.20.0",
    "scipy",
]
```

The Python Packaging Authority has a [guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) to writing the pyproject.toml file.


# Type Hinting

## Type Hinting {.smaller}

- PEP484
- A solution to statically indicate the type of a value.

- Yes in larger collaborative projects
- Not in scripts and hacking

# Closing

## Where can I get help? {.smaller}

BAS is developing a new Digital Innovation Team who can help with software engineering tasks and training:

* Tasked with developing common digital infrastructure
* Composed of four Research Software Engineers
* Contact [digitalinnovation@bas.ac.uk](mailto:digitalinnovation@bas.ac.uk)
  or [James Byrne (jambyr)](mailto:jambyr@bas.ac.uk) directly

The Technical Development Community (in Teams) can assist with general enquiries.\
For all IT requests, please use the IT ServiceDesk 

Look out for future training events including
[Software in Polar Science](https://software-in-polar-science.github.io/) in February.

## ICCS ReproHack {.smaller}

- March 12th 2024
- Climate science reproducibility hackathon
- [reprohack.org/event/27](https://www.reprohack.org/event/27/)
- Fully online

Come and learn more about software reproducibility by trying to reproduce results from papers. No advanced programming skills needed, you will work in teams and won't do actual coding, just trying to get submitted codes to run (with our support).\
If you would like some friendly feedback on your own code's reproducibility, please submit a paper.
