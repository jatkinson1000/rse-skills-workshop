## Naming For Clarity

It may seem inconsequential, but carefully naming variables and methods can improve the
readability of code massively and can help to make code self documenting.

A few naming tips and conventions:

- The name should show the intention, think about how someone else might read it (this could be future you)
- Use pronounceable names e.g. `mass` not `ms`, `stem` not `stm`
- avoid abbreviations and single letter variable names where possible
- One word per concept e.g. choose one of `put`, `insert`, `add` in the same code base
- Use names that can be searched
- Describe content rather than storage type
- Naming booleans, use prefixes like `is`, `has` or `can` and avoid negations like `not_green`
- Plurals to indicate groups, e.g. a list of dog objects would be `dogs`, not `dog_list`
- Keep it simple and use technical terms where appropriate
- Use explaining variables
