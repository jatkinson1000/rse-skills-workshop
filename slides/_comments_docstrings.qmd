# Comments and Docstrings


## Comments {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="66%"}

Comments are tricky, and very much to taste.

Some thoughts:[^1]

> "Programs must be written for people to read and [...] machines to execute."\
> &emsp; - Hal Abelson

> "A bad comment is worse than no comment at all."

> "A comment is a lie waiting to happen."

=> Comments have to be maintained, just like the code, and there is no way to check them!

## Comments to avoid {.smaller}

- Dead code e.g.
  ```python
  # plt.plot(time, velocity, "r0")
  plt.plot(time, velocity, "kx")
  # plt.plot(time, acceleration, "kx")
  # plt.ylabel("acceleration")
  plt.ylabel("velocity")
  ```
- Variable definitions e.g.
  ```python
  # Set Force
  f = m * a
  ```
- Redundant comments e.g. `i += 1  # Increment i`



## Comments - some thoughts^[Adapted from [@stackoverflow_comments]] {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

- Comments should not duplicate the code.
- Good comments do not excuse unclear code.
  - Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.
  - If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.
- Explain unidiomatic code in comments.
- Provide links to:
  - the original source of copied code.
  - external references where they will be most helpful.
- Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
- Comments are not documentation.
  - Read by developers, documentation is for...

## Docstrings {.smaller}

**These are what make your code reusable (by you and others).**

- In python docstrings are designated at the start of _'things'_ using triple
quotes: `"""..."""`.
- PEP257 [@PEP257] tells us _what_ docstrings should say.\
  Specific conventions tell us _how_ they should say it.
- Where comments describe how it works, docstrings describe how to use it.\
  Unlike comments, docstrings follow a set format.

Various formatting options exist: numpy, Google, reST, etc.\
We will use numpydoc it is readable and widely used in scientific code.\
Full guidance for [numpydoc is available](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).



## Docstrings {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Key components:

- A description of what the thing is.
- A description of any inputs (`Parameters`).
- A description of any outputs (`Returns`).

Consider also:

- Extended summary
- Errors raised
- Usage examples
- Key references
:::

::: {.column}
```python {code-line-numbers="|2|4-7|9-12"}
"""
Short one-line description.

Parameters
----------
name : type
    description of parameter

Returns
-------
name : type
    description of return value
"""

## Docstrings - pydocstyle {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[pydocstyle](https://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/) is a tool we can use to help
ensure the quality of our docstrings.[^2]

:::{ style="font-size: 75%;"}

```bash
(myvenv) $ pip install pydocstyle
(myvenv) $ pydocstyle myfile.py
(myvenv) $ pydocstyle mydirectory/
(myvenv) $
(myvenv) $
(myvenv) $ pydocstyle gyroradius.py
gyroradius.py:2 in public function `calculate_gyroradius`:
        D202: No blank lines allowed after function docstring (found 1)
gyroradius.py:2 in public function `calculate_gyroradius`:
        D400: First line should end with a period (not 'd')
gyroradius.py:2 in public function `calculate_gyroradius`:
        D401: First line should be in imperative mood (perhaps 'Calculate', not 'Calculates')
(myvenv) $
```
:::

Note: pydocstyle does not catch missing variables in docstrings.
This can be done with [Pylint's docparams and docstyle extensions](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/checkers/extensions.html)
but is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Exercise 4 {.smaller}

Go to exercise 4 and examine the comments:

- Is there any dead code?
  - How is it best to handle it?
- Are comments used sensibly?
  - Are any redundant and better off being removed?
  - Is there anywhere that would benefit from a comment?

Docstrings:

- Work through the file adding docstrings where they are missing.
- If you are unsure about variable types or meanings at any point you can sneak a look ahead to the code in exercise 5.


## READMEs {.smaller}
