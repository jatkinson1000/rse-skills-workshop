# Exercise 3 - Naming for code clarity

Look through the code for any names of methods or variables that could be improved or
clarified and update them. Note if you are using an IDE like Intellij or VSCode, 
you can use automatic renaming.
Can you find an example from each of the suggestions listed below?
Does this make the code easier to follow?

Consider the following:

- The name should show the intention, think about how someone else might read it (this could be future you)
- Use pronounceable names e.g. `mass` not `ms`, `stem` not `stm`
- avoid abbreviations and single letter variable names where possible
- One word per concept e.g. choose one of `put`, `insert`, `add` in the same code base
- Use names that can be searched
- Describe content rather than storage type
- Naming booleans, use prefixes like `is`, `has` or `can` and avoid negations like `not_green`
- Plurals to indicate groups, e.g. a list of dog objects would be `dogs`, not `dog_list`
- Keep it simple and use technical terms where appropriate
- Use explaining variables
