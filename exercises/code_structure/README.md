# Exercise  - Code Structure

This exercise is intended to practice spotting where code can be structured, how
this improves readability and reusability, and how that in turn enables using
code as building block to enable advanced functionality.


## Inspect and change the example code

Look at the code and identify duplicated code blocks as well as other code
snippets that could be moved into separate functions to increase readability and
reusability. Make those changes and experiment with the code -- what can you now
easily do?

## Inspect the changes

Look at the newly structured file and note the changes.

- Is it more readable?
- How does the new structure enables easier reuse of code blocks? What can this
enable you to do?
