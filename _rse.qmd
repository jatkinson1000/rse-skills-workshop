::: {.notes}
* Data processing - FFT, averaging, etc.
* Will inevetable be reused - making it good makes your life easier.
* Software should be valued more than it is.\
  At time of writing there isn't pressure to write well.\
  This is not a good long-term strategy, however.

## Why does this matter? {.smaller}

More widely than publishing papers, code is used in control and decision making:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
\

- Weather forecasting
- Climate policy
- Disease modelling (e.g. Covid)
- Satellites and spacecraft[^*]
- Medical Equipment

\

Your code (or its derivatives) may well move from research to operational one day.

```python
def calc_p(n,t):
    return n*1.380649e-23*t
data = np.genfromtxt("mydata.csv")
p = calc_p(data[0,:],data[1,:]+273.15)
print(np.sum(p)/len(p))

What does this code do?

```python

Kb = 1.380649e-23
T0 = 273.15

    Calculate pressure using ideal gas law p = nkT

    Parameters:
